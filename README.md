Travelogue
==========

My first Android project

With this app, a user can create a map of all his travels.

This version include:

  # Timer for automatic start and stop of application, with a optional message 
    about how many days, hours and minutes miss before the start of your holiday.
  # Automatic and transparent geotagging of photos on the map. It works though you don't activate geotag on
    the camera.
  # No need to change your favorite camera app. 
  # Statistics about how much time you are in travel, and the distance you have travelled.
  # You can fine-set gps intreval times, for battery saving.
  # Intelligent gps-managment and photo-gatering
  # You can backup your travels on SD card
  

Stil missing some features as:
  
  # Sharing on Facebook, Twitter, G+, ..
  # Automatic arranging of photos on SD card
  # Bug testing
